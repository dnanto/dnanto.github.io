  abstract = {Techniques for providing network security and anomaly detection are disclosed. In some embodiments, network traffic may be monitored in order to create a model of network traffic over a first period of time. Based on the model of network traffic, one or more inflated files may be created and stored on a system, wherein the inflated files are of a sufficient file size such that attempts to exfiltrate one or more of the files may be detected based by network monitoring tools. The inflated files may further include one or more indicators of sensitivity, including indicators of the presence of sensitive information that is not actually included in the inflated files. Network traffic characteristics may then be repeatedly or continuously monitored in order to update the size of the one or more inflated files based on changes in network traffic characteristics.},

  abstract = {Techniques for identifying and/or classifying genomic information are provided. In some embodiments, genomic information may be identified by computing systems without access to a database of reference genomic information, instead relying on locally stored probabilistic data structures representing reference genomic information. Query genomic data, such as data taken from a read-set, may be divided into sub-strings, and each of the locally-stored probabilistic data structures may be queried by each of the extracted sub-strings, generating probabilistic outputs indicating either that (a) the sub-string is probably included in the set of data represented by the probabilistic data structure or (b) the sub-string is definitely not included in the set of data. Based on the number and/or proportion of sub-strings from a read-set that are indicated as being likely represented by a probabilistic data structure, a likely identity or classification for the genomic information in the read-set may be determined.},
