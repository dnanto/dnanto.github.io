  abstract = {Food biosecurity is an element of biodefense, which includes protecting our food supply from bioterrorism as well as from accidental or natural contamination. As the cost of whole genome sequencing (WGS) falls, it is increasingly feasible to use it for real-time outbreak prevention and biosurveillance. Traditional microbiological detection methods require days or even weeks to identify the causative agent. BioVelocity, a Noblis- developed post-sequencing bioinformatics tool, utilizes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole genome sequences to rapidly identify unknown pathogens at the strain level. Currently, BioVelocity performs 100x faster than the industry standard for sequence read alignment. With BioVelocity, sequenced reads are directly subjected to analysis without requiring assembly or annotation, which greatly increases speed while maintaining fidelity. BioVelocity can align raw sequence reads, perform SNP detection and pathogen identification, and even metagenomic analysis in 23 seconds (per genome) or less for average-size microbiological pathogens. BioVelocity's unique indexing technology allows for unprecedented speed in identification of genomic regions that can be used as references for geographical association as long as the metadata are available. Additionally, relationships between serovars that frequently cause outbreaks every year can be determined using WGS. In 2012, a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella bredeney occurred stemming from Valencia peanut butter products. We previously demonstrated the power of our approach by applying BioVelocity to thousands of Salmonella sequences present in the Food and Drug Administration's BioProject. From there through a phylogenetic approach we were able to identify the cluster representing the 2012 outbreak and, for the first time, inferred additional food isolates in the database that were likely to have been related to the outbreak and, as far as we could determine were not previously associated as such. In this analysis, BioVelocity was used to analyze 103 genomes directly related to peanut butter food sources and specifically the 2012 outbreak in 40 minutes (23.3 seconds/genome). Noblis' work with this dataset demonstrates how BioVelocity can rapidly and accurately cluster, trace, and make inferences based on our results and accompanied sample metadata. Noblis is in the early stages of a pilot that would allow food producers or others in the food industry to submit data from their food safety testing programs to be sequenced and analyzed. Our goal is to help the food industry see the value of WGS to reduce the risks and costs of contaminated foods, improve food safety plans and procedures, and inform capital investment decisions. Additionally, our results indicate that BioVelocity has potential for improving food biosecurity for all by accurately detecting pathogens, quickly tracing outbreaks, and even differentiating between intentional or natural outbreaks through biosurveillance using our unique and efficient approach.},

Since most individuals carry optical detecting computers in their pockets (i.e., smartphones), a simple phone-based application can help mitigate the complexity in interpreting multiplexed assay results. Here we demonstrate a new computational tool to interpret color and position of multiplexed visual chips or plate-based assays using a smartphone camera, which works effectively in ambient lighting conditions. We tested our application on a Blind Spot, a multiplexed lateral flow immunoassay platform, that uses positional braille-based, gold particle capture-based readouts. Additionally, we tested the cell phone application on colorimetric Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reactions for quantitative analysis. The application correctly identifies positive signal positions and determines the intensity by color hex code changes to interpret and export the results in a simple graphical and tabular form. This technology reduces bias in results interpretation thereby improving the accuracy of multiplexed pathogen diagnostics. The phone application color determinations were compared with standard laboratory absorbance measurements to determine statistical agreement.},

  abstract = {Background: The role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the diversification of bacterial populations is well established. HGT events may result in acquisition of adaptive features such as virulence factors. The O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters in Vibrio cholerae are exemplary of this mechanism. The wb* gene clusters involved in O-antigen biosynthesis are specifically located on Chromosome I in the more than 200 distinct serogroups. The precise mechanisms and the pool of genetic variants of the biosynthesis genes are not completely elucidated. The availability of whole genome sequence data facilitates the quantification of O-antigen genetic diversity and understanding of the underlying evolutionary forces. Materials: The bioinformatics pipeline includes a workflow of scripts and tools to automatically download sequences, identify conserved regions, and establish phylogenies. Results: We have created a bioinformatics pipeline to extract the O-antigen biosynthesis regions from various V. cholerae draft genome sequences. The pipeline extracted the wb* regions from the whole genome sequences of O1, O139, and non-O1/O139 other strains. A detailed description of the pipeline is presented in this report. Annotation of the various wb* clusters and phylogenies based on wb* region junction genes and some conserved genes within the wb* clusters are compared to the phylogeny of the core genomes of the various strains. Conclusions: The results of the phylogenetic analyses indicate extensive gene transfer between serogroups similar to that found in other virulence regions. There are only very few known instances of en bloc HGT transfer of wb* clusters within the strains for which WGS are available. Analogous to serogroups O37 and O139 that have acquired different wb* clusters in an epidemic background, an instance of O1 antigen cluster (wbe) transfer to non-epidemic strain backgrounds have been found in this study. This study calls for WGS sequencing of the entire Sakazaki serogroup collection in order to assess genetic diversity and the reasons for the high epidemic potential of the O1 strain and its derivatives. The pipeline created here can be used as a general tool for extraction of specific genomic regions from draft genome sequences.},

This allows the user to easily edit the model without losing quality. Thus, the goal is to aid in the design of publication-quality diagrams to communicate results in molecular biology and nanotechnology. Initially, the code implemented Caspar-Klug Theory (1), which defines a method for the construction of icosahedral capsids. It is based on a parameterized walk over a hexagonal unit lattice, which starts by moving h units forward, turning 60 degrees (levo or dextro), and moving k units forward until a triangular face is carved. An additional step arranges the face into an icosahedron. Moody extended this model to account for bacilliform phages with fivefold symmetry (2). Here, an updated version of democapsid is presented based on results from Luque and Reguera, whose work generalized the models of Caspar, Klug, and Moody for elongated capsids with fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetry (3). Additional methods were developed to realize the corresponding three-dimensional structures and described here. The implementation is also consistent with the work of Twarock and Luque, which provides additional Archimedean lattices models (4).

Each genotype has unique properties with different tissue tropism or transmission route, causing illness including acute respiratory disease, keratoconjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. Epidemiology also correlates with genotype as some are more contagious, thrive in dense living conditions (such as barracks and universities), and cause outbreaks around the world with fatal outcomes or severe febrile illness. Thus, proper characterization of sample genomes is critical for understanding the evolution of these circulating and emerging pathogens. Typing via serum neutralization (SN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) are obsolete in the genomics era, especially since they only cover a small, imputed fraction of the genome. Additionally, recombination is a major evolutionary force and has been observed giving rise to new genotypes. As the virus evolves, so do the need and criteria for typing. This project investigates the potential for an updated informatics-based approach with the Nextclade tool of the Nextstrain suite, which is currently used for assigning SARS-CoV-2 samples to clades built with a curated set of reference sequences. This work also provides a dataset for testing Nextclade against DNA viruses since it is currently aimed at RNA genomes.},

  abstract = {Although less fatal than its cousin smallpox, monkeypox has spread around the world and evolved into clades I and II, with the latter being less virulent and more widespread. The ongoing outbreak of monkeypox requires clade-level sequence monitoring to understand the mutations driving human host-adaptation, spread, and divergence. For example, Nexstrain offers a live dashboard of geographic and phylogenetic breakdowns of sequenced samples hosted on databases such as GISAID EpiPox™. It is possible to monitor predicted PCR assay performance over time using this data to assess circulating variants and adapt existing countermeasures to emerging ones as they accumulate mutations. This is important since indels and mismatches near or within primer-binding regions can blind PCR-based surveillance operations, as was the case with the S-gene dropout phenomenon affecting SARS-CoV-2 assays. Noblis' BioLaboro pipeline includes tools to quickly recognize such problematic mutations and generate new assay candidates. The first phase builds a perfect-hash index of k-mers (k=50) from NCBI GenBank sequences and then determines which set is conserved within and signature to the target group based on subsequent alignment. Primer3 then generates candidate PCR primers based on those sequences. Finally, the PCR Signature Erosion Tool (PSET) analyzes their alignment and arrangement against databases hosted on NCBI and GISAID. The in vitro performance can be predicted based on thermodynamic calculations from Primer3 and informatic results from PSET. However, these combined methods are all in silico and verification in the laboratory is essential prior to deployment in the field. In this study, we generated 55 generic, 690 Clade I, and 1595 Clade II candidate assays and selected a subset for in vitro testing. We have confirmed the performance of five novel Clade I-specific assays. Failed candidates for generic and Clade II assays motivated the development of enhanced PSET reporting. We will present the findings of the Clade I and revised generic and Clade II primers from wet lab testing and compare them to the in silico predictions.},

The combinatorial nature of the algorithm required a parallel implementation to significantly reduce runtime. This investigation re-implements the algorithm to further reduce runtime in order to analyze a greater percentage of probes from microarray experiments involving Yersinia pestis, an emerging infectious pathogen that threatens human populations via zoonoses and potential bioterror attacks. Subsequent network motif analysis identifies key interaction patterns and proteins in pathways critical to pathogenicity. The resulting pipeline and model facilitates the design of proactive countermeasures against potential outbreaks.},

Detection is therefore critical for monitoring outbreaks and spillover in high-risk environments to prevent subsequent transmission across borders. Accordingly, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has motivated the design and deployment of numerous PCR and LAMP assays. However, pathogen evolution threatens the efficacy of assays as accumulated mutations help escape primer binding, resulting in false negatives. A continuous, biosurveillance-informed process can mitigate the emergence of blind spots by monitoring assay effectiveness and generating novel assays to replace failing or obsolete kits. To this end, we developed the BioLaboro pipeline to rapidly prototype PCR assays and monitor signature erosion over time. It is a modular system that uses data from GenBank to compute signature sequences (BioVelocity), primer generation (Primer3), and alignment-based validation (PSET) against millions of sequences. In this study, we extended the pipeline to include LAMP assay generation and validation. As an example, we determined whether plausible PCR assays exist for species and strain-level discrimination of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Our goal is to compare these assays to existing ones and distribute them to help inform vaccine development and detect outbreaks at borders or, ideally, at the source.},

  abstract = {In 2022, an outbreak of mpox spread through many parts of the world in an unprecedented way, challenging laboratories and public health agencies around the globe. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus. It is a linear double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Poxviridae family that has been listed by the WHO in its list of diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. The subset includes Smallpox (variola), Vaccinia, and Cowpox viruses. The human MPXV has two described clades -- the Central African/Congo Basin (CA) and West African (WA) clades. These clades are also referred to as Clade 1 and Clade 2, respectively. In general, it has been described that clade 1 is more virulent and has a higher fatality rate.  Because of this difference in virulence, knowing which strain of MPXV is circulating is important to patient management and control of the outbreaks. Thus any set of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays which differentiates the clades is of value to patient management and outbreak control, and a single assay which can differentiate which clade is circulating (for example a multi-plex PCR assay) would be ideal in managing this disease in the future. During the 2022 outbreak, clade-level sequence monitoring was required to understand the mutations driving human host-adaptation, spread, and divergence. It is possible to monitor PCR assay performance over time to assess circulating variants and adapt existing countermeasures to emerging ones as they accumulate mutations. This is important since indels and mismatches near or within primer-binding regions can blind PCR-based surveillance operations, as was the case with the S-gene dropout phenomenon affecting SARS-CoV-2 assays. Noblis' PSET quickly recognizes problematic mutations and generates new assay candidates. We used Noblis' PCR Signature Erosion Tool (PSET) to define a novel set of conserved sequences for differentiating clade 1 and clade 2  of MPXV, designed primers to flank those target sequences, evaluated those primers, and went on to develop a multiplex PCR assay utilizing our initial findings. Our analysis resulted in  the discovery of 55 generic, 690 Clade I, and 1595 Clade II candidate target regions (i.e., signatures). Optimal assay candidates (forward and reverse primers, probes) were chosen using PSET analysis and in vitro verification. The specificity of these candidates for their intended targets has been established and efficiencies are comparable to the CDC published primer sets. Using the optimal candidate for each target, a multiplex PCR assay was developed and tested using multiple mpox and other Orthopoxvirus controls. The resulting multiplex assay was found to be both sensitive and specific for both identification of MPXV and differentiation of clade I from clade II, all in less than two hours.  This multiplex PCR assay should prove useful in controlling MPXV globally and potentially in responding to the next MPX pandemic.  The PSET algorithm also monitors signature erosion, or the ability of deployed PCR assays to detect circulating MPXV strains, by indicating when mutations will cause detection PCR assays to fail.},
