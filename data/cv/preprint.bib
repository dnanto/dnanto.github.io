  abstract = {Background Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public health community's preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays. Results Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. Conclusions Here we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.},

  abstract = {BioLaboro is an application for rapidly designing de novo assays and validating existing PCR detection assays. It is a user-friendly new assay discovery pipeline composed of three tools: BioVelocity{\textregistered}, Primer3, and PSET. BioVelocity{\textregistered} uses a rapid, accurate hashing algorithm to align sequencing reads to a large set of references (e.g. Genbank) (Sozhamannan et al., 2015). BioVelocity{\textregistered} creates a k-mer index to determine all possible matches between query sequences and references simultaneously using a large RAM system (i.e. an IBM Power8). This algorithm makes it possible to very quickly identify sequences conserved within or omitted from a set of target references. Primer3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/ 61) is a tool for designing primers and probes for real-time PCR reactions. It considers a range of criteria such as oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content, and primer-dimer possibilities. We use Primer3 along with our signature detection process to identify potential new primer sets. PSET (PCR Signature Erosion Tool) tests PCR assays in silico against the latest versions of public sequence repositories, or other reference datasets, to determine if primers and probes match only to their intended targets. Using this information, an assay provider can be better aware of potential false hits and be better prepared to design new primers when false hits become intractable.},

  abstract = {In an evolving infectious disease outbreak, there are two priorities: rapid and accurate detection of the causative agent and characterization of its spread. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is an effective and portable diagnostic method that can quickly provide information associated with virulence, transmissibility, and pathogenicity. Compared to genomic sequencing, PCR requires less infrastructure, funding, and training. However, the development of sensitive and specific primer sequences is costly, particularly those with subspecies resolution. The recent mpox (monkeypox) virus outbreak underscores the need for the rapid development of clade-specific primers, particularly when there are differences in morbidity and mortality rates. Current mpox assays use primer sequences that also bind to the broader Orthopoxvirus genus, resulting in suspect diagnoses, delays in treatment, and poor allocation of scarce healthcare resources. Additionally, these orthopox-based primer sets cannot distinguish between different mpox clades and cannot illuminate intra-clade evolution over the course of the outbreak. Here, we present the in silico design and in vitro testing of novel clade-specific mpox assays.},

  abstract = {Microsatellites are repetitive DNA sequences comprised of an approximate tandem array of a relatively short base unit. The sequencing of eukaryotes in particular has revealed that microsatellites comprise large percentages of genomes. Research has also established the mechanisms responsible and the presumed roles of microsatellites in genetic regulation and disease. Accordingly, it follows that microsatellites occur on a non-random basis. The slipped-strand mutation (SSM) model also suggests that approximate microsatellite copies result from the inaccurate expansion of an original unit. Inexact repeats hinder microsatellite detection algorithm. Consequently, this investigation treats inexact copies as a gap between two repeats of exact repeats, otherwise termed junctions. 	This report concludes that junction counts are inversely proportion to the unit size of its constituent 5' and 3' microsatellite units. In addition, junction counts are inversely proportional to the edit distance score and gap (distance between) of its constituent units. Prevailing low scores and small gaps were in accordance with the SSM model, suggesting that junctions primarily derive from an initial, exact microsatellite. The inter-arrival time of the Poisson process and Monte Carlo junction simulation produced very similar junction counts expected per genome on a random basis. However, the predictions based on the proportions of microsatellites observed per genome were much higher. The observational data from the cow, zebrafish, fly, and human alike concludes that junctions occurred significantly greater than expected in these eukaryotic genomes.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Biomolecular pathways consist of non-random network motifs that establish the circuitry of evolved functions. Few studies have analyzed the network motifs of pathogens to develop virulence and infectivity models. In addition, databases lack comprehensive interaction data and over-represent model organisms. Accordingly, a recently introduced algorithm generated de novo co-expression networks directly from microarray data. The combinatorial nature of the algorithm required a parallel implementation to significantly re- duce runtime. This investigation re-implements the algorithm to further reduce runtime in order to analyze a greater percentage of probes from microarray experiments involving Yersinia pestis, an emerging infectious pathogen that threatens human populations via zoonoses and potential bioterror attacks. Subsequent network motif analysis identifies key interaction patterns and proteins in pathways critical to pathogenicity. The resulting pipeline and model facilitates the design of proactive countermeasures against potential out- breaks. Results: The investigation yielded a parallel implementation of the co-expression network generation algorithm that achieves runtimes that are inversely proportional to the number of processes. However, the thresholds to add edges and remove false positives result in networks with too many edges for analysis. Subsequent experimen- tation with other threshold routines and additional microarrays may rectify the problem. Nevertheless, there is potential to include an entire microarray probe set with the current communication frame- work or on an alternate system with globally addressable memory.
